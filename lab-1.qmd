## Load Packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
```

## Exercise 1

```{r ex-1}
ggplot(midwest)+
  geom_histogram( aes(popdensity), binwidth = 10000)+
labs(
  x = "Population Density",
  y = "count",
  title = "Population Density of Counties"
)
```
This histogram is right skewed. It looks like there is an outlier in between x=7500 and x = 100000

## Exercise 2

```{r ex-2}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(x = percollege, y = percbelowpoverty, color = state)) +
  geom_point() 
```
